(1)Ex4 â€“ With single parent, using super( ) in the child class to initialize the attribute(s):
	Create two classes based on the following UML diagram:
	In the Rectangle class (base):
-	Define the area(self) = length * width
-	Define the Perimeter(self) = 2 * (length + width)
In the Square Class (child)
	Use super().__init__(length, length) to initialize the lengh
-	Create rectangle object with (4, 5)
-	Create a square object with (6)
-	Display the areas of rec and square.
(2)
Results:
The cube results: length is 3, surface_area is 54, volume = 27
The square results:length: 3, area: 9, perimeter: 12
